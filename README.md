*MELON: 'Measuring the Emotional Leverage of Online Networks'*
## About
This project was created as the Final Work of Sarah Verbelen for the bachelor Multimedia and Communication Technology during the academic year 2020-2021. The project is made up of a few different parts: this repository is for the back-end API built in Python. The repository for the front-end can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahverbelen/melon) and the repository for the plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahverbelen/melon-plugin).

You can find the Postman collection for this api in the `/docs` folder.

## How to run the API
1. If you don't have python installed, [you can download the latest version here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. To install the requirements, run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python server.py`: starts a development build of the api on `http://localhost:5000`
